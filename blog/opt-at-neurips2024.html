Optimization was one of the top five topics at NeurIPS 2024, reflecting a clear trend of increasing interest in this area compared to previous years. While optimization in machine learning often focuses on specific tasks like training neural networks (using algorithms such as gradient descent and its variants), my focus here is on optimization in a broader sense.

This includes research exploring the use of AI methods for classical optimization problems, bridging the gap between traditional optimization techniques and modern AI-driven approaches. Below is a curated list of papers that stood out in this domain.
